<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class=section-info><em>This section is non‚Äênormative.</em>

<p class=XXX>This document defines the locale interface.

</div>

<div class=section>
<h2>Conformance</h2>

<p>The keywords "<em class=rfc2119>MUST</em>", "<em class=rfc2119>MUST
NOT</em>", "<em class=rfc2119>SHOULD</em>", and "<em
class=rfc2119>MAY</em>" in the normative parts of this document are to
be interpreted as described in <a
href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> <cite
class="bibref normative">[<a href="#ref-RFC2119">RFC2119</a>]</cite>.

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such
as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort
these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
("<em class=rfc2119>MUST</em>", "<em class=rfc2119>MAY</em>", etc)
used in introducing the algorithm.

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
<em class=rfc2119>MAY</em> be implemented in any manner, so long as
the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined
in this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not
intended to be performant.)

<p>User agents <em class=rfc2119>MAY</em> impose
implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs,
e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running
out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>This specification does not define how to construct the locale
object.

<div class="note memo">

<p>For example, a Web application framework can provides the
<code>$r->locale</code> method, where <code>$r</code> is the request
context object of the framework, returning the locale object for the
request.  The locale object is initialized with the language specified
by the <code>Accept-Language</code> request header.

<p>Likewise, a user object might have the <code>create_locale</code>
method, which returns a new locale object whose language is set to the
language specified by the user.

</div>

</div>

<div class=section>
<h2>The locale interface</h2>

<p>The locale object is expected to expose the set of text message
identified by message IDs (aka message catalog). How to determine the
language or other locale characteristics in use depends on the
implementation of the locale object and outside of the scope of these
requirements.

<p>The for_text_set method switches the message set in use. The locale
object specified to the locale method is expected to select the
default message set. The for_text_set method of the locale object is
expected to return another locale object which is selecting the
message set specified by the argument. If the specified value does not
identify a message set supported by the locale object, the method must
return an "empty" locale object, i.e. a locale object with no message
available.

<p>The plain_text method is expected to return the plain text
representation of the text message corresponding to the message ID
given as the argument. The method may return the undef value if no
text message is available for the message ID.

<p>The plain_text_as_components and html_as_components methods are
expected to return the plain text or HTML representation of the text
message corresponding to the message ID given as the argument,
respectively. The plain_text_n_as_components and html_n_as_components
methods are expected to return plain text or HTML representation of
the text message corresponding to the message ID and number given as
the argument, respectively. These two methods are expected to return
appropriate form of the message depending on the number, e.g. singular
or plural form.

<p>These four methods are expected to return the "components" data
structure representing the text message. The return value must be the
value that can be evaluated as an array reference. The array must
contain zero or more hash references. Such a hash reference must have
the type value. If the type value is text, there must be the value
value, which represents the plain text value for the component. If the
type value is html, there must be the value value, which represents
the HTML value for the component. If the type value is field, there
must be the name value, which represents the name of the field (or
parameter) for the component. The field component represents the
argument identified by the field name. The entire components represent
the concatenation of values represented by each component. No other
type is allowed at the moment. The html type is not allowed for
plain_text_as_components and plain_text_n_as_components methods. These
four method may return the undef value if no text message is available
for the message ID.
